Parliament, Tuesday, 2 June 2020 – The Standing Committees on Finance has agreed to a request from the Minister of Finance to postpone a virtual meeting scheduled to take place today. The committee was to be briefed by the National Treasury and the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) on the Mpati Commission of Inquiry report, as well as the implementation plan of the recommendations.
	
	Minister Tito Mboweni cited the need to first consult with Cabinet as the main reason for the request. He has not been able to discuss the report with Cabinet, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
	
	The committee has accordingly postponed the meeting until further notice, and a new date will be communicated in due course.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE, MR JOE MASWANGANYI.
