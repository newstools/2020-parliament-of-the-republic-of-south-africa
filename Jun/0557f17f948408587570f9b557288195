Parliament, Sunday 07 June 2020 – Hybrid plenary sittings of the National Assembly, the last leg of the virtual provincial review sessions of the 1994 Women’s Charter for Effective Equality in the Northern Cape and an extensive oversight over the executive by the Parliamentary Committees dominate matters in Parliament’s programme this week.
	
	The National Assembly is scheduled to hold its second hybrid sitting on Tuesday, 9 June 2020 at 14:00 to consider amongst others, three Bills, namely, the Social Assistance Amendment Bill, Prescription in Civil and Criminal Matters (Sexual Offences) Amendment Bill and the Recognition of Customary Marriages Amendment Bill.
	
	The Recognition of Customary Marriages Amendment Bill [B12 - 2019] aims to address a Constitutional Court ruling that section 7(1) of the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act of 1998 was inconsistent with the Constitution and invalid. This was because the section limited the right to human dignity and discriminated unfairly based on gender and race, ethnic or social origin against women who entered into polygamous customary marriages before the 1998 Recognition of Customary Marriages Act.
	
	Also on the agenda for Tuesday’s sittings is the consideration of reports recommending candidates to fill five vacancies on the Council of Independent Communications Authority of South Africa and Budget Votes.
	
	The provincial review of the 1994 Women’s Charter for Effective Equality sessions led by the Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), Ms Sylvia Lucas, will hold its last leg of virtual sessions with the Namakwa District on Wednesday, 10 June 2020 and the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality on Friday, 12 June 2020. The sessions are aimed at taking stock of the progress made in the implementation of the articles of the 1994 Women’s Charter for Effective Equality and assess its impact since the dawn of democracy. So far, four of the five districts of the Northern Cape have held virtual sessions.
	
	On Friday, the National Assembly will at 10:00 hold a hybrid plenary sitting to consider the 2020 Appropriation Bill with its votes and schedules.
	
	At least 34 meetings of the Committees of the two Houses – The National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces - are scheduled to hold virtual oversight meetings this week.
