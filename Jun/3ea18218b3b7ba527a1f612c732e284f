Parliament, Friday, 19 June 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Communications held a successful three-hour virtual seminar on spectrum management, as well as implications for effective parliamentary oversight on policy and regulations, which was facilitated by Ms Lucienne Abrahams, who is the Director for Link Centre at the University of the Witwatersrand.
	
	The committee welcomed detailed presentations on the subject matter by Prof Ewan Sutherland. Prof Sutherland is the independent telecommunications policy analyst and associate researcher at the Link Centre. The committee further welcomed reassurance by Prof Sutherland, who reaffirmed a position by the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa), that the 5G technology poses no risk to humanity.
	
	The committee is of the view that it has learnt a great deal, and that it will continue to have similar sessions in a way that it continues to be empowered to conduct effective oversight in the sector. The committee Chairperson, Mr Boyce Maneli, thanked both Ms Abrahams and Prof Sutherland for sharing their expert knowledge.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE COMMUNICATIONS, MR BOYCE MANELI.
