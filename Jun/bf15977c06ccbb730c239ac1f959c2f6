Parliament, Friday, 26 June 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs has called for an integrated roadmap outlining a clear framework on how to comply with the Constitutional Court ruling on remedying the Electoral Act.
	
	The stakeholders contributing to developing the roadmap will include the Minster of Home Affairs (representing the executive) and Parliament, with the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) offering technical expertise.
	
	Such a roadmap is urgent and must have clear timeframes, taking into consideration the 24 months given by the Constitutional Court, as well as the lead time needed by the IEC to prepare for the next national and provincial elections.
	
	The committee welcomes the assurance by the Minister that the executive has initiated a process in efforts to comply with the Constitutional Court ruling.
	
	The committee has committed to scheduling the next discussion on the matter first on its programme after the recess, highlighting the urgency necessary to reach a conclusion on the matter.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HOME AFFAIRS, ADVOCATE BONGANI BONGO.
