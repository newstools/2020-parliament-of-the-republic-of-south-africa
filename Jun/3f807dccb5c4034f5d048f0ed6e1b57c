Parliament, Tuesday, 30 June 2020 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry has noted that two Bills have been referred back to the committee for further deliberation and consideration.
	
	The Copyright Amendment Bill and the Performers’ Protection Amendment Bill were referred back to the National Assembly (NA) for consideration two weeks ago by President Cyril Ramaphosa, as he had some reservations about the constitutionality of the Bills. The Speaker of the NA, Ms Thandi Modise, in turn referred the President’s letter about his concerns to the committee.
	
	Committee Chairperson Mr Duma Nkosi said: “In terms of the Joint Rule 203(1) of Parliament, the committee must confine itself to the President’s reservations in its considerations. The committee is in the process of studying the referral and will schedule a meeting to consider the President’s reservations during the next term, as it has concluded all its meetings for this term.”
