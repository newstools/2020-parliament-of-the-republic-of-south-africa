Parliament, Friday 19 June 2020 – The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) at its plenary sitting today has passed the 2020 Appropriation Bill without amendment.
	
	Today’s plenary sitting was historic as the Appropriation Bill was passed for the first time in a fully virtual sitting of the House since the establishment of a democratic Parliament. This completes the process of passing the 2020 Appropriation Bill by Parliament.
	
	The passing of the 2020 Appropriation Bill followed the debate on the Bill and the Report of the Select Committee on Appropriations which was held on 18 June 2020. In its deliberations, the House acknowledged that the 2020 Appropriation Bill was introduced before the country and the world were hit by COVID-19. The Bill is intended to appropriate money from the National Revenue Fund for requirements of the State for the 2020/21 financial year.
	
	The Bill will now be sent to the President for his signature and assent as required by the Constitution.
	
	Minister of Finance Mr Tito Mboweni, is scheduled to introduce a Special Adjustments Budget on 24 June 2020 in the National Assembly.
