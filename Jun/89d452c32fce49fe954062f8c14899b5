Parliament, Wednesday, 17 June 2020 – The Chairperson of the Select Committee on Education and Technology, Sports, Arts and Culture, Mr Elleck Nchabeleng, told the committee in its virtual meeting today that the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill has been before it for some time and that it must complete its work on the Bill, so that it can be passed to its next step.
	
	After reminding the committee about the purpose of the Bill, Mr Nchabeleng read all the sections, including the memorandum of the Bill, and afforded members of the committee an opportunity to make comments, questions and to propose amendments to it. The committee unanimously agreed to adopt the Bill. It will now be taken to the National Council of Provinces for consideration and adoption.
	
	Mr Nchabeleng thanked the Department of Science and Technology for its “remarkable” support. “Without your support it would have been impossible to reach where we are today,” said Mr Ntshebeleng. He also thanked the committee and parliamentary legal services for their “sterling” contributions to the Bill.
