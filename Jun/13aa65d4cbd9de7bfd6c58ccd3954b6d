Parliament, Thursday, 4 June 2020 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) welcomes the arrest made this morning of eight senior police officers and six private citizens, including company owners and directors, involved in tender fraud.
	
	Scopa is pleased to note that the pressure it has been applying to the South African Police Service (Saps) to ensure consequence management where wrongdoing has been found, particularly where supply management processes were breached, is yielding results.
	
	Scopa has held several hearings with Saps on a number of financial mismanagement issues and has always called for the finalisation of investigations with the view to prosecute. This is why the committee appreciates this arrest of senior police officers implicated in these cases. Scopa believes that this is just one step and urges Saps to ensure that all the cases under investigation are water tight.
	
	The committee calls for Saps to continue in this positive way, by ensuring that every member of Saps and their accomplices implicated in these cases are brought to book.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF SCOPA, MR MKHULEKO HLENGWA.
