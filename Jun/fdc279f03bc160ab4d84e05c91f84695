Parliament, Saturday, 20 June 2020 - Parliament’s Presiding Officers, National Assembly Speaker Ms Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces Chairperson Mr Amos Masondo, have learned with shock the passing of Democratic Alliance Member of Parliament, Ms Thandi Mpambo-Sibhukwana yesterday.
	
	Ms Mpambo-Sibhukwana joined Parliament in 2014 as a Western Cape Permanent Delegate to the National Council of Provinces. After the 2019 National and Provincial government elections, she became a member of the National Assembly and served in the Portfolio Committee on Social Development.
	
	“The passing of such a devoted public representative, known for her hard work, passion, active participation in the work of Parliament and a firm grasp of issues relating to the committees she served, leaves a void in the oversight programme of Parliament. Without a doubt, she was a dedicated, diligent and a selfless patriot whose commitment to the country was unquestionable”, said Presiding Officers Ms Modise and Mr Masondo
	
	The Presiding Officers extend their heartfelt sympathies to Mpambo-Sibhukwana family, friends and colleagues.
