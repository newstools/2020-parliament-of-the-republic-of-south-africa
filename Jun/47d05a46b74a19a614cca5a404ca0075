Parliament, Wednesday 10 June 2020 – The Presiding Officers, led by National Assembly Speaker Ms Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces Chairperson Mr Amos Masondo, are deeply saddened by the passing of Ms Dorah Dunana Dlamini last night.
	
	Ms Dlamini, an African National Congress representative from KwaZulu-Natal, has been a Member of Parliament in the National Assembly last year, following the 2019 national and provincial elections. She attended yesterday's hybrid plenary sitting of the National Assembly which ended in the evening at 18h00.
	
	Ms Dlamini served in the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises and was amongst MPs who tirelessly ensured Parliament conducts appropriate oversight over the Executive, particularly during this period of Covid-19 pandemic.
	
	"Despite only joining Parliament last year, Ms Dlamini had already immersed herself well in the workings, intricacies and complexities of Parliament. She took part in the hybrid sitting of the House yesterday, joining through the virtual platform from her home in KwaZulu/Natal, and remained until the end of the session. We are deeply shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of such a dedicated parliamentarian."
	
	The Presiding Officers of Parliament send their heartfelt condolences to the Dlamini family, friends and comrades of the late Ms Dlamini.
