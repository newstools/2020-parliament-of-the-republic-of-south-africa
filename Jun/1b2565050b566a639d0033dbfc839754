Parliament, Thursday 04 June 2020 – The Office of the Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Thandi Modise, has noted with concern the circulation of a fraudulent email, purporting to be from her, requesting that people deposit money into some account.
	
	The fraudulent email claims that she is having problems with her bank account and is unable to make withdrawals, and asks prospective donors to deposit money into a cousin’s account.
	
	Similar scams, aimed at duping unsuspecting people into donating money into a fraudulent “European Development Fund”, did the rounds last year. Other scammers promised email recipients that Ms. Modise will connect them to “international funders” in exchange for an upfront payment.
	
	We urge the public, including the acquaintances of Ms. Modise, to remain vigilant and not fall prey to these repugnant scam merchants. Any email or text, including those usually sent from fake social media accounts, requesting or promising money must immediately be treated with suspicion and be ignored.
