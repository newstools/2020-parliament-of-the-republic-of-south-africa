Parliament, Thursday, 4 June 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Communications will hold a virtual meeting this evening, from 18:00 to 21:00, to consider and adopt a report on the resignation letter of one of the current Councillors of the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA). The letter was forwarded to the committee by the Acting Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies, Mr Jackson Mthembu.
	
	Earlier today, it was mentioned, in a similar media alert, that the Sub-Committee of the Portfolio Committee on Communications will hold a two-hour-long virtual meeting this evening, from 18:00 to 20:00, to deliberate on the outcome of the interviews of the 20 shortlisted candidates for the Media Development and Diversity Agency (MDDA) Board.
	
	It was said further that a full complement of the Portfolio Committee on Communications will then meet for an hour, from 20:00 to 21:00, through the same virtual platform, to consider and adopt the Sub-Committee report recommending candidates for appointment to the MDDA Board.
	
	However, the agenda item for today’s virtual meeting has changed, and the outcomes of the MDDA Board interviews will be deliberated on at a later date.
	
	Members of the media who would like to be part of the meetings to observe may forward their contact details to Mr Mlindi Mpindi on 081 716 7329 for inclusion in the Parliament Communications Service WhatsApp group, where login details will be shared.
