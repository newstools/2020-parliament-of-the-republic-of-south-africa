Parliament, Thursday, 12 November 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources and Energy will from tomorrow, 13 November 2020, undertake a two-day oversight visit to the PetroSA’s Gas-to-Liquid fuel (GTL) refinery plant in Mossel Bay, Western Cape. PetroSA is reportedly experiencing shortage of feedstock, which could result in massive job losses. The company also experienced a number of challenges over the years, including, among others, governance failures, whereby it ended up losing R14 billion on drilling gas that it could not find. PetroSA is one of the 11 entities of the newly formed Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, whose work the committee plays an oversight on. It is a subsidiary of the Central Energy Fund (CEF) Group that is currently undergoing restructuring. The oversight visit forms part of the committee’s programme, and it comes at the back of the unanimously adopted report on oversight to the Lily and Optimum coal mines in Mpumalanga, Northam platinum mine in Limpopo and illegal mining hotspots in Gauteng.
