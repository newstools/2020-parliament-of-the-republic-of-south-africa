Parliament, Tuesday 3 November 2020 – The Sub-Committee on the appointment of the Central Drug Authority (CDA) which comprises of the Portfolio Committee on Social Development and the Select Committee on Health and Social Services, is from today 3 to 5 November conducting interviews on shortlisted candidates to serve on the CDA Board.
	
	Chapter 10 of the Prevention of and Treatment for Substance Abuse Act (No. 70 of 2008) sets out the process for the appointment of the CDA. The Committee issues this statement as a discharge of its constitutional obligation to facilitate public involvement through information sharing in the process of nominating candidates to be recommended for appointment onto the CDA.
	
	The Department of Social Development invited nominations for suitably qualified South Africans to serve on the CDA board. It forwarded 64 CVs to the Sub-Committee to conduct the recruitment process as stipulated in the Prevention of and Treatment for Substance Abuse Act. The Sub-Committee shortlisted 26 candidates to consider for interviews.
	
	Two of the shortlisted candidates withdrew from the process, and three did not meet the set requirements. The Sub-Committee will thus interview 21 candidates that meet the set requirements.
	
	Details for the interviews are as follows:
	
	Venue: Good Hope Chamber, Ground Floor, Good Hope Building
	Date: Tuesday, 3 November 2020
	Time: 09:00-18:30
