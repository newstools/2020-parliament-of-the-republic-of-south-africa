Parliament, Wednesday, 25 November 2020 – The Acting Secretary to Parliament, Ms Baby Tyawa, yesterday, called upon parliamentary stakeholders, internally and externally, to participate in its annual stakeholder satisfaction survey aimed at assessing parliament’s efforts to improve its service delivery to the people. Addressing the last Joint meeting of the Whips and Committee Chairpersons of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) this year on a virtual platform, Ms Tyawa said independent research findings show many areas of improvement and also flag some areas that require interventions. She said Parliament has since 2014/15 financial year, commissioned annual independent research projects as part of its monitoring and evaluation model, aimed at assessing the impact of its numerous communication and stakeholder engagement programmes. She said, over 90% of the South Africans know Parliament, 74% understands its mandate, while 72% of external stakeholders appreciates Parliament’s efforts to promote public participation in its activities, an improvement of 21% compared to the 2018/19 wave of Parliament’s survey programme. Even its employees rate Parliament positively as an employer of choice, as overall 82% gave thumbs up with 25% of that rating it very positively while those rating Parliament negatively continue to decline. Ms Tyawa appealed to all stakeholders to continue to respond well to the now IPSOS-led online survey that is necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic. She assured all stakeholders that their confidentiality is guaranteed, as Parliament wishes to get honest reflections as the findings are used to inform its strategic planning and interventions to improve its services to the people of South Africa.
