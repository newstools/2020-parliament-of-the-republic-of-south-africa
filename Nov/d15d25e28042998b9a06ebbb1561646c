Parliament, Friday, 6 November 2020 – The Sub-Committee on the Filling of Vacancies to the Central Drug Authority board (CDA) of the Portfolio Committee on Social Development and the Select Committee on Health and Social Services yesterday concluded a three-day interview process of shortlisted candidates to serve on CDA board.
	
	The committee was impressed with the calibre of the 21 candidates interviewed. Candidates demonstrated a deep passion, commitment and dedication in the fight against the scourge of drug and substance abuse in the country. They displayed an understanding and knowledge of challenges at legislative, policy and societal levels and came up with sound solutions.
	
	On Friday, 13 November 2020, the committee will consider and deliberate on the reports of the candidates’ performance and the entire recruitment process. The report will thereafter be referred to both the Select Committee on Health and Social Services, and the Portfolio Committee on Social Development for consideration and adoption.
	
	Their recommendations will be submitted to the Minister of Social Development for consideration and appointment.
	
	The Co-Chairperson of the Sub-Committee, Mr Mondli Gungubele, emphasised that there should be a correlation between candidates’ interview performance and the Sub-Committee’s recommendations.
