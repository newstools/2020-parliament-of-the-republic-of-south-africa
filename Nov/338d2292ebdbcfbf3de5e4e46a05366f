Parliament, Monday, 16 November 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Communications has noted developments in the media with regard to labour unrest at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). Although the committee has not received a formal report on the unrest, it believes that meaningful engagements between all stakeholders can only serve the public broadcaster and the South Africans better. The committee is scheduled to meet with the SABC on Wednesday, 18 November 2020, as a continuation to the meeting of 28 October 2020 to, among other things, look at the repositioning of the SABC to deliver on its public mandate. The committee is accordingly looking forward to the Wednesday meeting in order to also be informed on the current state of affairs and the SABC’s plan of action to adequately address the matter.
