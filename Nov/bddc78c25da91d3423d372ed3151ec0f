Parliament, Wednesday, 4 November 2020 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, wished the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize and his wife well as they recovered from Covid-19 infection and are back at work. “We wish the Minister and his wife well and all the best as they reassume their work after their successful quarantine,” said Dr Dhlomo.
	
	The committee received an update today from the parliamentary staff on procurement of an external service provider for the processing of the National Health Insurance (NHI) submissions and to consider the provincial NHI public hearings report.
	
	The committee heard that only one service provider responded to the advertisement calling for interested service providers to submit quotations for the processing of the submissions on NHI, and it has agreed to use the parliamentary service instead of the private service providers to process the NHI report.
	
	The committee welcomed the first draft provincial report on NHI and asked members who have content that is not captured in the report to submit it for incorporation.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, DR SIBONGISENI DHLOMO.
