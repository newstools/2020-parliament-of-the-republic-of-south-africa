Parliament, Tuesday, 10 November 2020 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Ms Faith Muthambi, has called for free and fair by-elections in all 96 wards countrywide tomorrow. “We wish for all the by-elections to be free and fair. We call upon all South Africans to keep all the Covid-19 protocols of social distancing, washing of hands with soap or to sanitise at the voting stations when they exercise their right to elect their councillors. Furthermore, we call upon IEC officials, representatives of political parties and community leaders at voting stations to ensure that by-elections are not turned into platforms to spread the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Ms Muthambi. By-elections are scheduled to take place in 96 wards across 461 voting districts nationwide tomorrow, 11 November 2020. According to Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), by-elections have not been held since March 2020 following the declaration of a National State of Disaster and the lockdown restrictions intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
