Parliament, Wednesday, 11 November 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Health has congratulated the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize, on being appointed the Chairperson of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Elimination 8 Ministers of Health Council. The Elimination 8 (E8) is a coalition of eight countries working across national borders to eliminate malaria in southern Africa by 2030. The E8 is pioneering an ambitious regional approach and driving collective action to end this deadly disease once and for all. Guided by the belief that countries are stronger when they work together, the E8 is building a model that will inform coordinated efforts in southern Africa and beyond. Committee Chairperson Dr Sibongiseni Dr Dhlomo said: “No province other than KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Limpopo has ever had malaria. South Africa has done well over the years to reduce malaria in these three provinces. The new challenge is now to eliminate malaria altogether. Together with seven other SADC countries, South Africa is committing to eliminate malaria and we support the department’s plan.” ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, DR SIBONGISENI DHLOMO.
