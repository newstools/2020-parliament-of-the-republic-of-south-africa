Parliament, Wednesday, 11 November 2020 – Parliament’s Presiding Officers, Speaker of the National Assembly Ms Thandi Modise and Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces Mr Amos Masondo, have learnt with shock and sadness the untimely passing on of Auditor General of South Africa, Mr Kimi Makwetu. “Mr Kimi Makwetu was a consummate professional, and an outstanding servant of the people who remained dedicated and uncompromising in serving the nation till the very end. He was a diligent, a man of integrity, a rare breed who fully understood the intricate work of Parliament and was instrumental in the institution's fulfilment of its oversight functions over various spheres of government,” said the Presiding Officers. His outstanding work ethic, professionalism, fight against fraud and corruption and dedication to eradicating all forms of wasteful and fruitless expenditure from the public purse, is a remarkable legacy that will remain with us forever”, added the Presiding Officers. It was during his terms that Parliament passed the Public Audit Amendment Act, to which Mr Makwetu played a key role in its processing, to give the Office of the Auditor-General more teeth to ensure better consequence management and accountability. Mr Makwetu joined the Office of the Auditor General in 2007, and was appointed after Parliament’s recommendation to serve as Auditor General from December 2013, and his non-renewable term of office was due to end on 30 November 2020. Parliament extends its heartfelt condolences to his wife, children, family, friends and colleagues. May his soul rest in peace.
