Parliament, Tuesday, 24 November 2020 – The Powers and Privileges Committee today postponed the hearings into the incident that took place on 11 July 2019 during the budget vote speech of the Minister of Public Enterprises, Mr Pravin Gordhan. The committee had scheduled the hearings that involve 16 Members of Parliament to begin today. The committee has however received a briefing from the Initiator appointed by Parliament that included correspondence between Parliament and the legal representative of the affected Members of Parliament. The committee was informed that counsel appointed by the affected Members is not available today and can only be available tomorrow. The committee has not received any formal application from the affected Members to request for legal representation. The committee therefore could not consider a matter that has not been tabled formally before it. The committee will consider the application for legal representation when it is tabled formally before it. To show fairness to the affected parties and the request that was put before the committee via the Initiator, the committee agreed to reschedule the hearings to begin tomorrow.
