Parliament, Thursday, 26 November 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on International Relations and Cooperation has congratulated South Africa’s Consul General to Los Angeles Ms Thandile Sunduza. Ms Sunduza has been unanimously nominated by the L.A Area Chamber of Commerce to the position of 2021 Vice Chair and 2022 Chair of the Diplomatic and Commercial Officers Group. The Chairperson of the committee, Ms Tandi Mahambehlala, said Ms Sunduza has already made an impact in the South African office in Los Angeles. “She brings with her youthful exuberance which South Africa and Africa must benefit from. Her role and energetic search for effective avenues must enhance economic diplomacy right from the start of President Biden’s era.” Ms Mahambehlala said the economic spin-offs from the nomination of Ms Sunduza were much desired to address the triple challenges facing South Africa. The committee looks forward to her leadership in the coming year.
