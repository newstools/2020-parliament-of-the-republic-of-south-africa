Parliament, Friday, 6 November 2020 - The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture has today learnt with shock the passing of the first black President of the SA Rugby, Mr Silas Nkanunu,
	
	Mr Nkanunu, the legendary sports administrator passed on aged 87.
	
	The committee sends its condolences to the family, friends and the entire rugby community.
	
	He pioneered change in the SA Rugby boardroom and in international rugby when the system of apartheid refused to accept change. He walked right into the belly of conservative South African rugby politics and proved that black people were capable not only to play rugby but to administer it.
	
	His presidency at SA Rugby did not only champion transformed and unified sports, but it coincided with the introduction of the professional era. Mr Nkanunu took over presidency of a tumultuous SA Rugby from Mr Louis Luyt in the late 1990s.
	
	Without a doubt, Mr Nkanunu’s departure is a loss to the emerging rugby administrators.
