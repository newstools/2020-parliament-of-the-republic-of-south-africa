Parliament, Tuesday, 3 November 2020 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has urged the South African Police Service (SAPS) to heighten cooperation with other relevant state organs and government departments in the fight against corruption within SAPS. SAPS appeared before the committee today to present a progress report on cases of supply chain management corruption involving SAPS officials.
	
	The committee welcomed the work SAPS has done internally on cases of corruption. In welcoming the briefing, the committee thanked General Khehla Sitole for the significant strides taken and urged him to sustain the momentum of cleaning the rot in the SAPS.
	
	The committee told General Sitole that the report and the evidence of SAPS’s focus on corruption has allayed its anxiety. The committee awaits good results and encourages SAPS to do the right thing
