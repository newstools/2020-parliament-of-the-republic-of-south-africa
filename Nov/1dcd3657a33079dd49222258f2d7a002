Parliament, Wednesday, 11 November 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Tourism, (National Assembly), today received a briefing by South African Tourism (SAT) on their Annual Performance Report for 2019/20 financial year. The committee appreciated the presentation and took into consideration the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic which has affected the entity from achieving its targets. The committee has noted the report of the Auditor-General on South African Tourism which received an Unqualified Audit Opinion with findings in the 2019/20 financial year. The Auditor-General made a number of findings with regard to internal control deficiencies which the entity needs to address urgently in order to improve the audit outcomes in future. The committee raised their concerns on the impact of the looming second wave of the Covid-19 infections as seen in other parts of the world. The tourism industry has to be extra cautious and we approach the season of high domestic movement. The committee urges all travelers to be vigilant and to adhere to Lockdown Level 1 protocols of social distancing, washing of hands and sanitizing to avoid the spread and increase in infections.
