Parliament, Tuesday, 24 November 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Defence and Military Veterans today met with the office of Auditor-General (AG) for a briefing on findings and audit outcomes pertaining to the financial and non-financial performance of the department and its entities for the 2019/20 financial year. The AG presented on the performances of the Department of Defence, Department of Military Veterans, Armscor and the Castle Control Board (CCB). Committee Chairperson Mr Cyril Xaba commended the CCB for achieving a clean audit and advised the entity to sustain the trajectory. He was, however, concerned that both the departments of Defence and Military Veterans “did not respond with the required urgency to risk and improving internal controls”, saying this explains why issues of irregular expenditure are not resolved. “The AG report exposes weak internal controls and if it continues the department will struggle to prevent non-compliance and that is a serious indictment”, said the Chairperson. The committee also noted allegations of fraud and misconduct in the department’s supply chain management and that 50 percent of cases have not been investigated, along with risk areas that are insufficiently investigated.
