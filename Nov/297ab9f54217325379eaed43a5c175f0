Parliament, Wednesday, 11 November 2020 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, calls on all healthy citizens to donate blood as low levels of blood have been recorded. Media reports indicate that the country has low levels of blood available to help pregnant mothers when they have difficult labour, cancer patients and those who unfortunately get involved in motor vehicle accidents. Dr Dhlomo said: “What makes the situation even more challenging is that most of our students who normally donate blood are writing exams, we urge all citizens who are over the age of 16 years and are in good health to visit blood donation centres and donate blood.” Dr Dhlomo made these remarks as he finished donating blood at MegaCity in Umlazi on Monday.
