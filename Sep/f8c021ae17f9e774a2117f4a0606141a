Parliament, Friday, 4 September 2020 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) Portfolio Committee on Public Works and Infrastructure as well as the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs will tomorrow undertake a joint oversight visit to the Beit Bridge border to assess the construction of the 37km border fence which was procured as part of interventions to fight Covid-19.
	
	The committees have received briefings individually on procurement and construction of the fence, and subsequent investigations thereof.
	
	These investigations had highlighted a range of acts of misconduct during procurement and construction of the fence. This is the reason why both committees have decided to visit the site to assess the work done by the money taken from the national fiscus.
	
	The Portfolio Committee on Public Works and Infrastructure has raised serious concerns about weak systems in the Department of Public Works that are intended to prevent malpractice and corruption when procuring services. Furthermore, non-compliance to Section 217 of the Constitution, Public Finance Management Act, National Treasury practice notes and the department’s own procurement regulations were identified as causal factors to weaknesses when procuring services.
	
	Scopa has called for an in-depth investigation into the Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure’s directive on the procurement of the fence. The committee had also instructed the department to submit a full report on the procurement of the fence by Friday, 28 August 2020. The committee will use the report to assess the work done at the border.
