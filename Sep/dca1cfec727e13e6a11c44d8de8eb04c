Parliament, Friday, 4 September 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Employment and Labour was today briefed by the Auditor-General (AG) on audit reports of the Covid-19 Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme (TERS), which is administered by the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF). This follows a proclamation by the President instructing the AG to audit all Covid-related government transactions.
	
	The committee also received briefings from the Department of Employment and Labour, and its entities on procurement process of personal protective equipment (PPE) for Covid-19.
	
	The committee noted with concern reports of fraud and corruption on the payment of TERS which involved overpayments and underpayments of beneficiaries, undeserving individuals such as civil servants, inmates and even deceased people.
	
	Committee Chairperson, Ms Lindelwa Dunjwa, commended the department for the swift action in putting senior officials of the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) on precautionary suspension to allow the Special Investigative Unit (SIU) to do its work.
	
	Ms Dunjwa said: “We hope all money lost due to fraud and corruption will be recovered, if it means people go to jail, they must pay for their wrongs.”
	
	ISSUED BY PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON EMPLOYMENT AND LABOUR, MS LINDELWA DUNJWA.
