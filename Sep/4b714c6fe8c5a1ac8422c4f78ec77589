Parliament, Sunday 13 September 2020 – Consideration of Covid-19 tax Bills; debates on International Democracy and Heritage Days, including a heritage lecture, are items scheduled to conclude the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) third term programme this week.
	
	The NCOP will, from 21 September, join the National Assembly (NA) on the constituency period. The NA started its constituency period on September 7 and both Houses will return for the fourth term programme on October 5.
	
	On Tuesday’s virtual plenary, the NCOP will hold a Debate on International Democracy Day under the theme: “Reaffirming the values and principles of our constitutional democracy.” The plenary will also consider various reports of Committees and the quarterly progress reports from the Magistrates Commission.
	
	On Wednesday the NCOP will hold a virtual Heritage lecture to be addressed by the Executive Director of the South African Cultural Observatory, Ms. Unathi Lutshaba. She will provide a macroeconomic mapping perspective of South Africa’s overarching cultural and creative industries while highlighting the impact of Covid-19 on the sector.
