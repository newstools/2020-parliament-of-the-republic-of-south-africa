Parliament, Tuesday, 29 September 2020 – The Joint Sub-Committee of the Standing and Select Committees on Finance and Appropriations which is tasked with the responsibility to recommend a candidate for appointment as the Director of the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO), will today, interview the six shortlisted candidates.
	
	While the committee had shortlisted nine candidates for interviews, however, three of them have withdrawn their candidatures on personal reasons. The committee remains satisfied that the remaining six candidates constitute enough pool of candidates to proceed with the interviews despite the withdrawal of the three candidates.
	
	The PBO plays a critical role in the provision of independent, objective and professional advice and analysis to the Members of Parliament on matters related to budget and other money bills. It is based on this critical reason that the minimum requirement for the position is a Master’s degree in either finance, economics, public finance or a related field (PhD is preferable), and a minimum relevant experience of 10 years.
	
	The committee has ensured that its processes that include a call for public comments on the shortlisted candidates, are open and transparent as per Section (15) (7) of the Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters Act No.9 of 2009 which outlines the establishment of the PBO.
	
	In line with the promotion of meaningful public participation by the legislative sector in the work of Parliament, the interviews will be broadcast on all the parliamentary communication platforms to ensure access to both the public and the media.
