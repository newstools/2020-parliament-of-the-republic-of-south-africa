Parliament, Wednesday, 9 September 2020 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Sport, Arts and Culture, Ms Beauty Dlulane, notes with disappointment the decision of the Swiss Federal Tribunal to uphold a decision of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) regarding the IAAF (World Athletics) regulations on female athletes with differences in sex development (DSD).
	
	Ms Caster Semenya approached the Swiss Federal Tribunal in May last year after CAS, sport's highest court, ruled that World Athletics’ regulations were necessary for athletes with DSD in races ranging from 400 metres to a mile, to ensure fair competition.
	
	According to media reports, the tribunal has found that the requirement of subjecting certain female athletes to drug or surgical interventions as a precondition to compete, does not amount to a violation of Swiss public policy.
	
	Ms Dlulane said the committee has always believed that the World Athletics regulations are a violation of fundamental human rights of DSD female athletes. Furthermore, she said the committee did not hesitate to join other forces of justice to rally behind the appeal by both Ms Caster Semenya and Athletics South Africa (ASA).
	
	“Notwithstanding this disappointing decision of the Swiss Federal Tribunal on Ms Semenya’s appeal, the committee still believes that the Court of Arbitration for Sport’s decision against Ms Semenya is a violation of Semenya’s fundamental human rights and assures its (the committee’s) support behind her,” said Ms Dlulane.
