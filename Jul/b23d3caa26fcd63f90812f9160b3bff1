Parliament, Monday, 20 July 2020 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Ms Tina Joemat-Pettersson, has welcomed the speedy arrest and court appearance of a suspect in the murder case of Gauteng MPL Mr Mapiti Matsena.
	
	“The speedy arrest is testament to the good capabilities of the police and will hopefully bring justice to the Matsena family,” Ms Joemat-Pettersson said. The arrest should further strengthen the credibility in the police to resolving acts of crime expeditiously.
	
	The chairperson encouraged the police to ensure that investigations are completed quickly and qualitatively, to ensure that prosecutions deter criminal acts. The committee hopes the police will work with the prosecution team to ensure an effective prosecution.
	
	All criminals must be removed from our streets to ensure that safety and security return to our streets. Furthermore, the community must work hand-in-hand with police in the fight against crime, as crime has social and economic impacts on everyone.
	
	The committee extends its heartfelt condolences to the Matsena family for Mr Matsena’s senseless and brutal murder.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON POLICE, MS TINA JOEMAT-PETTERSSON.
