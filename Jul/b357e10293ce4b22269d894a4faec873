Parliament, Wednesday, 15 July 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Small Business Development, as well as the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, Economic Development, Small Business Development, Tourism, Employment and Labour were briefed jointly on the revised medium term strategic framework (MTSF), annual performance plans (APPs) and budgets of the Department of Small Business Development, as well as the Small Enterprise Development Agency (Seda) and Small Enterprise Finance Agency (Sefa).
	
	The department, Seda and Sefa presented their adjusted MTSF, APPs
	d and budget subsequent to the Revised Fiscal Framework tabled by the Minister of Finance on 24 June 2020. The committees cautioned that budget reductions should not compromise transformation for youth, women and people living with disabilities.
	
	The committees welcomed the R100 billion that has been set aside by government to offer loans to small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) and cooperatives. However, they are concerned that only five mainstream banks will be involved in loaning the state guaranteed R300 billion to all businesses. The committees believe firmly that the arrangement should include development financial institutions.
	
	The committees emphasised once again the need for the department and entities to have a comprehensive communication strategy that will reach beneficiaries in the most remote areas. They appreciated the process led by the National Treasury to amend the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act and believe that the outcome will be beneficial to SMMEs and cooperatives. Furthermore, they welcomed the SMME and Cooperatives Funding Policy announced by the Minister.
	
	Additionally, the committees welcomed the 20 days’ baseline target to pay SMMEs and cooperatives for goods and services rendered to the department, as announced by the Minister. They encouraged the Minister to strengthen accountability to the Acting Director-General of the department and entities in order to ensure that all targets are met. This will include implementing measures that will allow virtual oversight in order to ensure that beneficiaries receive prompt and quality services.
