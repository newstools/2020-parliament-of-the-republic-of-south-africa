Parliament, Saturday, 4 July 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture has learnt with shock the passing of the legendary Mary Twala on Saturday.
	
	The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Sports, Arts and Culture, Ms Beauty Dlulane, said the committee sends its heartfelt condolences to members of the family, friends, arts community and to all South Africans.
	
	“We are saddened by the news of mama Twala’s passing during a time when arts in our country and the world is under enormous pressure as a result of the Coronavirus. This is a legend who lit up the South African television screens for decades,” said Ms Dlulane.
	
	“This is surely not a time to be sad, but we should celebrate that we’ve had the honour of calling this legend our own, and shared her with the world,” she added.
	
	Ms Dlulane said this was the end of an era and that it would be difficult for the arts community to produce another Mary Twala.
	
	“Mary defined television acting and ever shone brighter than the glow it brought. The country has lost.”
