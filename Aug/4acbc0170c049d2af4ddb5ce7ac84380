Parliament, Monday, 24 August 2020 –The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, met with KwaZulu-Natal’s (KZN’s) MEC for Health, Ms Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu over the weekend and agreed that it would be important to clear the confusion that was created by the committee’s media statement that was issued last week, on Wednesday, 19 August, where the committee said it was disappointed about the failure of Ms Simelane-Zulu attend its scheduled virtual meeting.
	
	Dr Dhlomo said, the statement did not reflect that Ms Simelane-Zulu did come to the committee meeting and asked to be excused as she had to brief the provincial cabinet on the current state of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. “After my welcoming remarks, I allowed the MEC to leave the meeting. I did not open a discussion on her apology to leave the meeting,” said Dr Dhlomo
	
	After Ms Simelane-Zulu left the meeting, Dr Dhlomo said: “Committee members felt that I should have asked the MEC to re-join the meeting, and that became impossible as she had started presenting in the cabinet meeting. As the Chairperson of the committee, I apologise for the harm that the lack of clarity in the statement might have caused, and we have both agreed that our improved communication will avoid such a situation in the future.”
