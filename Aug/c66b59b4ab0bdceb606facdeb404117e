Parliament, Monday, 24 August 2020 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Technology, Mr Philly Mapulane has expressed concerns over the delays in the procurement of the laptops for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) qualifying students.
	
	It is now four months since Minister Nzimande announced that government will procure laptops for all NSFAS qualifying students in universities and Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges as part of government's strategy to facilitate multi-modal remote learning and teaching methodologies in order to save the 2020 academic year as a result of the country being placed under lockdown.
	
	Students have since being eagerly awaiting the delivery of these laptops which to date remain undelivered as a result of unnecessary delays in the finalisation of the procurement processes by NSFAS.
	
	Of great concern, are the allegations brought to the committee, that there is interference with the procurement processes. Attempts are being made to manipulate the procurement process, and to finally get it aborted because certain service providers are not recommended following supply chain management processes of NSFAS.
	
	The committee takes these allegations seriously and will be following them up with the Administrator of NSFAS, Dr Randall Carolisen. "We would like to appeal to Dr Carolisen not to allow any undue interference with the supply chain management processes of NFSAS, and to speedily conclude this process of the procurement of the laptops so that students from poor and working class families can be able study and be taught remotely. The country cannot afford another Covid-19 procurement scandal" said Mr Philly Mapulane
