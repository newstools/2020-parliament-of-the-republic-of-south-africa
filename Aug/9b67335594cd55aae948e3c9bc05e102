Parliament, Saturday 01 August 2020 – Parliament’s Presiding Officers, led by Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Thandi Modise and Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces Mr Amos Masondo, have learned with shock and sadness the passing of ANC Member of Parliament, Mr Zamuxolo Peter, yesterday due to Covid-19 related illnesses.
	
	Mr Peter joined Parliament in 2019 as a member of the National Assembly. He served in the Portfolio Committee on Tourism and Joint Standing Committee on Auditor General.
	
	“The loss of another public representative and South Africa to this disease is heart-breaking. Hon. Peter was a selfless and consummate servant who, despite being relatively new to Parliament, immersed himself well in the workings of Parliament and its constitutional functions. He was an asset to the committees he participated in, where he particularly demonstrated subject matter knowledge. He was passionate about rural tourism and was at the forefront of the vigorous pursuit of fearless oversight for the development of rural tourism as a catalyst for the rural economy. We will remember him fondly for his passion, dedication and hard work in the service of the constituencies he represented and the people of South Africa in general”, said the Presiding Officers.
	
	We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and comrades; and all South Africans whose loved ones succumbed to the virus.
	
	The Presiding Officers continue to urge South Africans to remain vigilant and guard their safety against the virus by protecting themselves and their loved ones.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA.
