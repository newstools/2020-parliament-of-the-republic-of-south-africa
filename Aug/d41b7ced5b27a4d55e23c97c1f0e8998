Parliament, Wednesday, 19 August 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Health expressed its disappointment after the MEC for Health from KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), Ms Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, failed to attend the scheduled meeting.
	
	The committee adjourned the meeting, as committee members were of the view that the meeting could not continue when the MEC was absent. The committee said the absence of the MEC is delaying the programme of the committee.
	
	The committee said it is unacceptable for the MEC to tender an apology just before the start of the meeting. The committee said the MEC knew about the meeting and did not formally write to the committee to indicate that she would not be available.
	
	The committee agreed that the matter should be reported to the Speaker of Parliament and the House Chairperson.
	
	Committee Chairperson, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, informed the MEC that the committee meeting was scheduled for Wednesday and that there was no other day where members could attend.
	
	The committee agreed to reschedule the meeting for a later date.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, DR SIBONGISENI DHLOMO.
