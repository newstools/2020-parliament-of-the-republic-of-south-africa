Parliament, Tuesday, 25 August 2020 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services has learnt with great sadness of the death of committee member and African National Congress whip of the committee, Adv Hisamodien (Hishaam) Mohamed.
	
	Committee Chairperson Mr Bulelani Magwanishe said Adv Mohamed became a Member of Parliament last year after the 2019 national elections. Prior to that, he served as the Western Cape head of the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, where he focused on providing access to justice, improved services and promoting community participation in the criminal justice system, particularly at courts servicing vulnerable communities.
	
	“It was indeed a great honour for us to work with the late Honourable Mohamed. Access to justice for all was very close to his heart and this was clear from the questions he asked during our meetings. This is indeed a great loss for all of our people, but especially so the people of the Western Cape, who he served so loyally and diligently,” said Mr Magwanishe.
	
	“Our thoughts are with his family, friends and loved ones. May his soul rest in peace.”
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE AND CORRECTIONAL SERVICES, MR BULELANI MAGWANISHE.
