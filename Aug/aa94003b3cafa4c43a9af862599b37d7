Parliament, Friday, 21 August 2020 – “As the Portfolio Committee of International Relations and Cooperation, we commend the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, under the resolutely firm and unwavering stewardship of Dr Naledi Pandor, for not joining those suffering from solipsism syndrome, who are involved in the rampant and egoistic race for self-enrichment at the expense of the sick, meek, and the frontline workers who need the PPEs to fight the coronavirus pandemic, which is ravaging across the length and breadth of this country.
	
	“As an oversight body, we are awed and encouraged by the department’s adherence to supply chain prescripts, and not being tempted by egocentric loners with overinflated sense of self-worth, and self-absorbed with tenders at the cost of the lives of the sick and needy of this country,” said Ms Tandi Mahambehlala, the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee.
	
	“We continue to condemn,” continued Ms Mahambehlala, “in no uncertain terms, and join our voices with the people of South Africa who have expressed disgust and anger at corruption in the Covid-19 PPEs contracts.”
	
	The Portfolio Committee has noted with interest President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement of the SIU probe in his 23 July address to the nation, and the Cabinet’s decision of 5 August to establish a ministerial task team to compile a comprehensive list of Covid-19 contracts.
	
	We also heard Finance Minister, Mr Tito Mboweni’s repeated observation of how the thieves were waiting at the door, underscoring the extent of corruption, fraud, irregularities and maladministration.
	
	“The steadfast and uncorrupted leadership of the minister has steered the department from the graft, and we applaud that,” added Ms Mahambehlala.
	
	The inputs by the committee on the need for responsible conduct of public affairs and management of public resources is evidently bearing fruit.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND COOPERATION, MS TANDI MAHAMBEHLALA.
