Parliament, Sunday, 23 August 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Social Development is deeply saddened by the passing of the Deputy Director-General of the Department of Social Development, Ms Connie Nxumalo. It extends its condolences to her family and to the staff of the department, and also wishes her family strength during this difficult time.
	
	The committee has worked very well with Ms Nxumalo and has appreciated the professionalism which she has always portrayed when she discharged her duties. Ms Nxumalo had become part of the committee as she faithfully and joyfully attended its weekly meetings. She happily shared her vast wealth of knowledge of the social welfare sector with the committee.
	
	Furthermore, Ms Nxumalo demonstrated a great passion, deep love and full dedication to her work and that sustained her progressive cooperation with members of the committee and its administrative staff. Most importantly, she was always available to assist members of the committee with all their enquiries even during the most difficult lockdown period.
	
	The committee will definitely miss her warm smile, enthusiasm, love and her excellent work ethic. The country has lost a special jewel in her, a woman of strength, and a true leader.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, MR MONDLI GUNGUBELE.
