Parliament, Tuesday, 25 August 2020 – Parliament’s Presiding Officers, Speaker of the National Assembly Ms Thandi Modise and Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces Mr Amos Masondo, are saddened by the passing-on of former African National Congress Member of Parliament, Kgosi Piet Mohlamme Mathebe, yesterday.
	
	Kgosi Mathebe was a Member of the National Assembly since the first democratic Parliament from 1994 to 2011 and served in various Committees including the Portfolio Committee of Environmental Affairs, Water and Sanitation as well as Home Affairs. He was later appointed Ambassador to Zambia in 2011.
	
	“Kgosi Mathebe was a fearless son of the soil who dedicated his life serving the people of the country with diligence. His commitment to building a just society forced him to face the brutal and oppressive apartheid government head-on as he fully participated in the student protests that led him to leave his country of birth,” said the Presiding Officers.
	
	“We will fondly remember him for his sharp mind, his immense understanding of issues affecting his people and his humbleness,” added the Presiding Officers.
	
	We extend our heartfelt condolences to Kgosi Mathebe’s family, his people, and pay homage to his legacy of selflessness and integrity as a public representative and a lifelong activist.
