Parliament, Sunday 16 August 2020 – Members of the National Assembly (NA), who embarked on a constituency period on 3 August, return on Tuesday to a busy week. The National Council of Provinces is scheduled to return from its constituency period on 25 August and will resume plenary House sittings then.
	
	Three plenary sittings of the NA, Public hearings and 49 committee meetings are among the issues coming up in the week ahead.
	
	On Tuesday, is a hybrid plenary sitting of the NA, starting at 14.00 and scheduled to hold two debates.
	
	The first debate marks National Women’s Day and is themed: “Generation Equality – Realising women’s rights for an equal future”. The second debate, scheduled as an urgent matter of national public importance, has been sponsored by the Economic Freedom Fighters’ Chief Whip Mr Floyd Shivambu. This debate is titled: “Solidarity with #BlackLivesMatter – Reinforcing the commitment of all South Africans to confront and defeat individual and institutional racism in our society and everywhere else it exists”.
	
	Also on Tuesday, the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development will hold virtual public hearings on the Upgrading of the Land Tenure Rights Amendment (ULTRA) Bill from 09:00. The Bill seeks to address the unfair discrimination of women based on their gender to their right of tenure as found in the case of the Rahube matter, where the deed of grant was tested as it applied to only males. In the Rahube matter, it was an automatic transfer to the male.
	
	Wednesday’s hybrid NA sitting, starting at 15.00, is scheduled to feature an oral questions session with six Ministers in the Peace and Security Cluster – Defence and Military Veterans, Home Affairs, International Relations and Co-operation, Justice and Correctional Services, Police, State Security.
