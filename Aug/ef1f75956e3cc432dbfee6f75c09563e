Parliament, Sunday, 2 August 2020 – The Chairpersons of the portfolio and select committees on transport, Mr Mosebenzi Zwane, and Mr Kenneth Mmoiemang, have called for an inclusive approach in all the meetings that are intended to improve the taxi industry.
	
	The Department of Transport, on Friday briefed a joint meeting of the committees about the pending Taxi Indaba.
	
	“We are happy with the progress that the department is making in all aspects of the industry and all the efforts to improve public transport. But the Ministry needs to ensure that the perception that government is not working with some and working with others should be resolved.”
	
	All stakeholders are significant in the industry and could not just be ignored. In trying to improve the image of the industry, the Chairpersons said, all the role players should be regarded as important and worthy of attention.
	
	The Chairpersons said the formalisation of the industry was key and that code of conduct was necessary to ensure semblance and promotion of unity in the industry.
	
	Furthermore, they said reimagining the industry should also include the matter of availing subsidies, an improved Taxi Recapitalisation Programme and functioning interconnectedness with the rest of the public transport modes.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSONS, MR KENNETH MMOIEMANG AND MR MOSEBENZI ZWANE.
