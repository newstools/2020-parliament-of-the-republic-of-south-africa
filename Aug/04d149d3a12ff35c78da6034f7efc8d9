Parliament, Tuesday 4 August 2020 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises, Mr Khaya Magaxa, has welcomed the summons issued by Eskom and the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to recover funds from the former Eskom executives, board members and members of the Gupta family and their associates, as well as from others.
	
	Mr Magaxa said the latest development of the summons issued by the North Gauteng High Court is a move that will ensure that those who are implicated and alleged to be involved in corruption at Eskom, account for their actions of self-enrichment.
	
	In light of the recent development, Mr Magaxa said: “We hope that other processes within the ambit of the law enforcement agencies and judiciary can be fast-tracked, such as those within the National Prosecuting Authoring and the Zondo Commission.”
	
	Furthermore, Mr Magaxa said corruption is a disease that threatens the potential of the country for economic development. “It must be exposed and uprooted,” he emphasised.
