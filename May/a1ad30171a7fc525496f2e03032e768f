Parliament, Thursday, 14 May 2020 – The Select Committee on Education, Technology, Sports, Arts and Culture welcomes the sensible decision to cancel the Comrades Marathon.
	
	The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Elleck Nchabeleng, said given the latest figures of positive cases in the country, and that KwaZulu-Natal is among the four provinces recording highest positive cases, this was the best decision.
	
	“The committee welcomes the cancellation and believes it is in the interest of participants at heart. Any possible interventions and steps should be taken to ensure that the virus spread is contained.
	
	“The urge to continue with the season among many sporting codes is understandable, but that should not be at the expense of the athletes."
	
	The Comrades Marathon is run annually in June, but this year it had initially been postponed to around September due to the lockdown, but that has since been cancelled.
	
	Mr Nchabeleng said the urgency to resume with sports activities should not come at the risk of exposing athletes and spectators to the Corona virus.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION, TECHNOLOGY, SPORTS, ARTS AND CULTURE, MR ELLECK NCHABELENG.
