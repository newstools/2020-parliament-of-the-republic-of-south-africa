Parliament, Thursday, 14 May 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation will this evening conclude its deliberations on the Department of Water and Sanitation’s 2018/19 annual report and financial statements.
	
	Due to time constraints on Tuesday, the committee could not conclude its consideration of the report it received from the Auditor-General and the department on the overall performance of the portfolio in the 2018/19 financial year. “This necessitated that we arrange another meeting in order to adequately consider the reports and allow Members of Parliament the opportunity to ensure sufficient interrogation of issues,” said Ms Machwene Semenya, the Chairperson of the committee.
