Parliament, Saturday, 16 May 2020 – The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA), Ms Faith Muthambi, will lead a delegation consisting of traditional leaders, local councillors, community leaders, and senior officials from the departments of health and social development that will tomorrow visit Malulele’s Ntlaveni Township, in Limpopo Province.
	
	Malulele’s Ntlaveni Township is part of Ms Muthambi’s constituency. After Ms Muthambi noted the low level of awareness about Covid-19 in certain parts of her constituency, particularly in Malulele Township, she called on all the relevant role-players around Malulele Township to join her in raising awareness about Covid-19 in the community.
	
	The visit follows the reports which Ms Muthambi received of a 52-year-old woman who is being stigmatised and discriminated against in the township for allegedly being COVID-19 positive, although the woman was tested negative. Ms Muthambi said: “The community needs to be educated about the effects and the impact of the virus and, based on that, I am taking all the relevant role-players to accompany me to the community. We are hoping that the woman gets the necessary counselling and support that she requires.”
	
	Details of the visit:
	
	Date: Sunday, 17 May 2020
