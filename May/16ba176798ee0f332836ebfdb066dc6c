Parliament, Wednesday 13 May 2020 – The Presiding Officers of Parliament wish to express our sadness at the passing away of eNCA cameraman Mr Lungile Tom, following infection with Covid-19.
	
	Through his sharp eye and knowledge of Parliament, Mr Tom brought the, often intricate, workings of the institution to many South African homes.
	
	His news footage demonstrated remarkable passion, experience and creativity. He spent time in the corridors of Parliament and, with patience, humility and passion, highlighted the happenings of Parliament to the people.
	
	The Presiding Officers of Parliament extend their heartfelt condolences to the family of Mr Tom, to his friends and eNCA colleagues and we wish them strength during this time.
	
	We also send our sympathies to all those who have lost loved ones to the Covid-19 pandemic and we wish all those who are infected a speedy recovery.
	
	We urge all people living in South Africa to continue to observe the government’s Covid-19 regulations and to adhere to all social-distancing and hygiene guidelines.
