Parliament, Wednesday, 27 May 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Public Service and Administration today adopted and supports the budget vote reports of the Department of Public Service and Administration, Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, Public Service Commission, National School of Government and Statistics South Africa (Stats SA).
	
	The adoption of the departments and its entities’ budget votes is part of the process of deliberating and approving the five-year strategic plans and annual performance plans as required by the Money Bills Act of 2009.
