Parliament, Monday, 6 January 2020 – The Chairperson of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, Economic Development, Small Business Development, Tourism, Employment and Labour, Mr Mandla Rayi, says the loss of Dr Richard Maponya is a massive blow to economic and business development in South Africa, and losing such a giant of black business is traumatising.
	
	“There is nothing Dr Maponya has not achieved in business through hard work and quiet nature. He epitomised business success and sometimes during the most challenging times in our country,” he said.
	
	Dr Maponya who was ninety-nine years old, passed on in the early hours of today, Monday, 6 January 2020 after a short illness. He was the owner of the famous Soweto’s Maponya Mall, and was also the first black person to open a BMW dealership in the township.
	
	Mr Rayi said the aspiring young black business entrepreneurs need to emulate the fallen giant, and make sure that they contribute to the economy, and the upliftment of black business.
	
	The committee sends its condolences to the Maponya family, friends and the entire business community.
