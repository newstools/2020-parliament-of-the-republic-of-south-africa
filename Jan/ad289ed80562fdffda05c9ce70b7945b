Parliament, Thursday, 07 January 2020 – Parliament’s Presiding Officers, led by National Assembly Speaker Ms Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces (NCOP) Chairperson Mr Amos Masondo, have learnt with shock and sadness the passing of former NCOP Deputy Chairperson Ms Thandi Memela today.
	
	Ms Memela, an ANC liberation struggle stalwart who was affectionately known as “Mama Thandi”, was born on 08 January 1939. She served as Deputy Chairperson to the NCOP from 2009 to 2014, and subsequently as Chairperson for the Portfolio Committee of Women and Children from 2014 to 2019.
	
	“Mama Thandi was a true patriot who sacrificed and dedicated her life to the emancipation of all South Africans. She was a nurturer, a community builder, and a vociferous voice of the voiceless who always put the interest of others first. Her extensive background in community development helped strengthen Parliament’s legislative programme, including the institution's focused approach to tackling issues of women and youth through sectoral Parliaments," said the Presiding Officers.
	
	“A nurse by profession, she remained true to her calling and tirelessly championed women and children’s rights. Our task is to take forward the baton and further build on her legacy as a champion for equality and social justice” added the Presiding Officers.
	
	The Presiding Officers extend their heartfelt condolences to her family, friends and her political home, the African National Congress. May her soul rest in peace.
