Parliament, Sunday, 12 January 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Defence and Military Veterans welcomes the probe into the causes behind the South African Air Force plane crash in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, 9 January 2020. The SA Air Force Lockheed C-130BZ Hercules aircraft which reportedly carried 67 passengers including members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) was on its way back from the City of Beni, where logistical support was provided to the SANDF that is deployed in the region. The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Cyril Xaba said: “We are relieved that no one was injured during the crash, but we need a full report on what went wrong and ensure that there are measures in place to prevent the reoccurrence of such incidents.” Mr Xaba said that the Defence industry is under severe pressure and the SANDF is not in a position to lose strategic assets because of the country’s fiscal challenges. The committee will, during the next term, invite the Department of Defence for a briefing on the details of the crash and the measures that are put in place.
