Parliament, Monday 13 January 2020 - The Presiding Officers of Parliament, led by National Assembly Speaker Ms Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces Chairperson Mr Amos Masondo, have cautioned against Members of Parliament making public threats to disrupt the business of Parliament. They said such threats were irresponsible and showed lack of understanding for one's duty to the public. The caution by the Presiding Officers follows reported threats, by EFF leader Mr Julius Malema, to disrupt the President's State of the Nation Address, scheduled for 13 February 2020. While the Presiding Officers would not lose any sleep over such threats as there exists appropriate mechanism to ensure that no disruption takes place, they find such perennial threats ahead of key parliamentary programmes objectionable and an unnecessary distraction to the institution's commitments to South Africans. The complex challenges confronting our country requires capable public representatives who endeavour to strengthen Parliament's Constitutional function of fearless oversight over the Executive, not impede its work.
