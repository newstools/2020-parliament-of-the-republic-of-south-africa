	Professor Bozzoli, who joined Parliament in 2014 as a Member of the National Assembly, served in the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Technology.
	
	“Parliament is left poorer with the passing on of a formidable scholar and a renowned writer who used her knowledge and expertise to the service of the people and advancement of the oversight work of Parliament. She was passionate about the education sector, and despite her ailing health, she continued to serve and contributed immensely to the oversight programme of the committee. She leaves behind an indelible mark, which will always be cherished, as it represents the dedication, selflessness and patriotism that South Africa needs to advance development”, said the Presiding Officers.
