Parliament, Thursday, 31 December 2020 â€“ The Presiding Officers of Parliament, led by the Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Thandi Modise, and the Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces Chairperson, Mr Amos Masondo, wish all South Africans a happy and successful 2021.
	
	The year 2020 has been a challenging year for the country. Covid-19 affected various areas of life and ushered in a new way of socializing and working. Most companies in an effort to curb the spread of the virus resorted to letting their employees work from home. We went through hard lockdown which tested our resilience as a country. The socioeconomic impact has been devastating. Families lost their loved ones, people fought for their lives while others lost their jobs.
	
	Parliament like many had to adjust to the new normal. It enhanced its systems and conducted much of its business through communications technology to advance its constitutional functions of oversight, law-making and public involvement. It was indeed a testing year for all of us but, challenges notwithstanding, we have as a nation weathered the storm.
	
	We have achieved a lot as a nation, and there is no doubt that, united in our diversity, we can accomplish more. We wish and hope that 2021 will bring with it much desired restoration and recovery.
	
	May our hope be renewed, out faith be emboldened, our resilience never fails us and our collective strength conquer the challenges that lie ahead.
	
	Happy New Year South Africa.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA
