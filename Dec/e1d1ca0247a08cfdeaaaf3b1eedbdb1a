Parliament, Wednesday, 2 December 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Public Works and Infrastructure appreciates the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure’s prompt response in reporting on the committee's recommendations after the oversight visits to the Beitbridge border fence and the Jersey Barrier.
	
	This shows that there are attempts at consequence management to fix the problems that arose in these projects. The committee has raised concerns with the steps taken to ensure that staff suspensions do not affect the department's work. The committee also wants the department to ensure that in-year monitoring functions more effectively so that problems are picked up prior to them negatively affecting projects.
	
	The committee is concerned with the lack of project timeframes, which could contribute to delays. The report back does not provide a phased timeframe to show how the department will address the problems identified by the committee.
	
	The committee wants to emphasise that the department, as the coordinator and maintenance department for service delivery departments, must put regulations in place through its intergovernmental relations branch so that, in future, projects are implemented with proper memorandums of agreement.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORKS AND INFRASTRUCTURE, MS NOLITHA NTOBONGWANA.
