Parliament, Thursday, 8 October 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) will tomorrow, 09 October 2020, visit eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality to assess service delivery and the state of the municipality.
	
	The visit’s key goal is to ensure that municipalities achieve their objectives as stipulated in Section 152 of the Constitution. “The perennial problem of negative audit outcomes by municipalities in the country is worrying, and requires our collective resolve and focus if we are to change this worrying course. The committee, in exercising its oversight role, saw it prudent to visit KwaZulu-Natal and eThekwini Metropolitan to meet the leadership of the municipality and assess service delivery and implementation of audit improvement plans in the province,” said Ms Faith Muthambi, the Chairperson of the committee.
	
	The committee will also interact with the Office of the Auditor-General, the South African Local Government Association, Provincial Treasury and the Department of Cooperative Government at both national and provincial level. The committee will also interact with stakeholders such as traditional leaders, ward councillors, rate payers’ associations, civic organisations, business and churches to understand and find workable, long-lasting solutions of the challenges they face as receivers of services.
	
	The committee will also receive a progress report on a petition from the residents of Ward 52.
