Parliament, Sunday 4 October 2020 – Budget Review and Recommendation Reports (BRRR), the Women’s Charter Review Sessions, three-sphere Sector Parliaments Planning Sessions and 57 Committee meetings will kick off Parliament’s fourth term programme this week.
	
	Every year following the adoption of the Appropriations Bill and prior to the adoption of the reports on the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement, Committees are required to compile and submit a BRRR for each department for tabling in the National Assembly (NA). They are required to scrutinise the annual reports and financial statements of government departments (and entities) to assess the effectiveness and efficiency with which they use and allocate available resources. Through the BRRR process Parliament committees get an opportunity to review and make recommendations on each department’s spending and forward allocation of these available resources. NA Committees will kick start the BRRR process this Tuesday.
	
	On Tuesday and Wednesday the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) Deputy Chairperson Ms Sylvia Lucas and the NA Deputy Speaker Mr Lechesa Tsenoli will convene a planning session to determine the overarching policy priorities of the Sixth Parliament via a virtual platform under the theme: “Towards a Sectoral Oversight Framework: Strengthening Three Sphere Coordination and Oversight, Through a Targeted Policy Focus, for Accelerated Implementation.”
	
	On Thursday, the NA Programming Committee will hold a virtual meeting at 8:30 to consider, deliberate and finalise its fourth term programme.
	
	On Friday, NA Deputy Speaker Tsenoli and NCOP Deputy Chairperson Lucas will host two Women’s Charter Review virtual report back sessions with four district municipalities from the North West province. The first session will take place from 9:00 to 12:00 with the Executive Members of the Dr. Ruth Segomotsi Mompati and the Dr. Kenneth Kaunda District Municipalities, women’s civil society groups and various other relevant government/non-government entities and stakeholders. The second session will be with the same stakeholders in the Ngaka Modiri Molema and Bojanala Platinum District Municipalities from 15:00 to 18:00.
