Parliament, Thursday, 22 October 2020 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) will tomorrow conduct an oversight visit to the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC).
	
	Scopa plans to conduct an on-site inspection of SABC’s financial management to establish the root cause of the irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure. When Scopa met with the SABC last month, it found inconsistencies between the responses provided by the SABC and information contained in the annual report.
	
	The committee is interested in the technological capabilities of SABC’s systems and will also assess financial controls and consequence management.
	
	Details of the meeting are as follows: 
	Date: Friday, 23 October 2020
	Time: 08:30
	Venue: SABC Offices, Auckland Park, Johannesburg
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES.
