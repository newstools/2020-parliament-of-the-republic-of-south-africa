Parliament, Monday, 05 October 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs will from tomorrow, 06 October 2020, undertake a four-day oversight visit to KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) to assess the impact of Section 139 interventions and audit improvement plans in municipalities in the province.
	
	The aim is to ensure that municipalities achieve their objectives as set out in Section 152 of the Constitution. “The perennial problem of negative audit outcomes by municipalities in the country is worrying and requires our collective resolve and focus if we are to change this worrying course. The committee in exercising its oversight role saw it prudent to visit KZN to assess implementation progress and associated impact of Section 139 interventions in municipalities in the province and also to meet municipalities and assess implementation of audit improvement plans in the province,” said Ms Faith Muthambi, the Chairperson of the committee.
	
	Tomorrow, the committee will meet the MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs in the province to get a briefing on Section 139 interventions in the province.
	
	The committee will then in subsequent days visit Ugu District Municipality, Umgungundlovu District Municipality and Ethekwini Metropolitan Municipality. The committee will also interact with stakeholders such as traditional leaders, ward councillors, rate payers’ associations, civic organisations, business and churches to find workable solutions to challenges facing municipalities.
