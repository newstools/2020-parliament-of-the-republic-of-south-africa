Parliament, Wednesday, 14 October 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) will tomorrow continue its engagement with Emfuleni Local Municipality on the state of the municipality. The municipality has experienced various challenges that led to the Section 139 (1) (b) intervention by the provincial government.
	
	Following the meeting with the municipality the committee will also interact with stakeholders within the municipality. This interaction is part of the committee’s efforts to get a holistic view of service delivery to the people in the municipality. “We have taken a decision to move away from getting a one sided and subjective view of government in performing oversight. We have entrenched a culture of getting a first-hand information of service delivery from the recipients of the services,” said Ms Faith Muthambi, the Chairperson of the Committee.
	
	In the afternoon, the committee will proceed to Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality to assess the state of the municipality and the provision of services to the residents of the municipality.
