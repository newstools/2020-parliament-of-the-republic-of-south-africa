Parliament, Tuesday, 13 October 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development learnt this morning of the death of Dr Vuyo Mahlati.
	
	The Chairperson of the Agriculture Committee, Inkosi Zwelivelile Mandela said, “We are deeply saddened to hear of the death of the President of the African Famers Association of South Africa, a strategist, gender activist and public policy and development planning specialist. It is a profound loss not just to the farming community, but to South Africa at large”.
	
	Dr Mahlati was the former Chair of the Presidential Advisory Panel on Land Reform and Agriculture and also served on the National Planning Commission. She was hailed as a land reform champion for her efforts in the transformation of the agriculture and land sector, notably for her stand on the expropriation of land without compensation. Her contribution to the farming sector is immeasurable, as she was the owner of Africa’s first indigenous wool processing plant in the Eastern Cape. She chartered new territories with success.
	
	The committee sends its condolences to the family, friends, farming community and the African Farmers Association of South Africa.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, LAND REFORM AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT, NKOSI ZWELIVELILE MANDELA.
