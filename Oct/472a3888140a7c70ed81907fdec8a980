Parliament, Sunday 11 October 2020 – A joint hybrid sitting address by President Cyril Ramaphosa, the Ministerial Briefing on Labour and Budget Review and Recommendation Reports, are some of the agenda items as the fourth and last term of Parliament’s programme enters its second week.
	
	On Tuesday, Employment and Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi will be briefing the National Council of Provinces on the measures to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
	
	On Wednesday, the Standing Committee on Finance will hold virtual public hearings on the Auditing Profession Amendment Bill. The Bill aims to amend the Auditing Profession Act of 2005, to amongst others, strengthen the governance of the Regulatory Board and strengthen the investigating and disciplinary processes. On the same day, the NCOP Deputy Chairperson Ms Sylvia Lucas and Deputy Speaker Mr Lechesa Tsenoli will host a virtual Women’s Charter Review Session in the City of Tshwane and Ekurhuleni Metropolitans. The hearings are part of a series of public hearings which have been held across the country to take stock of progress made in implementing the articles of the Women’s Charter since the advent of freedom and democracy.
	
	The National Assembly(NA) Committees will this week continue with the Budget Review and Recommendation Reports (BRRR). BRRR for each department are compiled and submitted by Committees for tabling in the NA. This is done every year following the adoption of the Appropriations Bill and before the adoption of the reports on the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement. Through the BRRR process Parliament committees get an opportunity to review and make recommendations on each department’s spending and forward allocation of these available resources.
	
	President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the two Houses of Parliament in a joint hybrid sitting on South Africa’s economic reconstruction and recovery plan on Thursday at 14:00. On the same day, both houses will hold virtual Programming Committee meetings at 8:30 to consider, deliberate and finalise their fourth term programme.
