Parliament, Thursday, 22 October 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Small Business Development was briefed on Wednesday morning by the Development Microfinance Association (DMA) on its mandate and challenges in working with small enterprises and its response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Gauteng provincial Department of Economic Development also briefed the committee on its Gauteng Township Economic Bill.
	
	The committee welcomed the DMA’s presentation and said the association should be supported in its work, as it supports poor and hard-working entrepreneurs in rural communities. The association was established in 2005 as a non-profit company and is constituted by the Development Microfinance Institutions.
	
	The committee also hailed the draft Gauteng Economic Development Bill as a move in the right direction. The Bill is about taking deliberate steps to allow townships to become fully-fledged commercial zones, both by streamlining the rules on where and how one can run a business, and by providing different kinds of programmatic support to small, medium and micro enterprises operating in townships.
	
	The committee undertook to investigate the possibility of having a similar Bill at a national level. It will also develop a consolidated list of all Bills in its portfolio that should be tabled during the 6th term of Parliament.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, MS VIOLET SIWELA.
