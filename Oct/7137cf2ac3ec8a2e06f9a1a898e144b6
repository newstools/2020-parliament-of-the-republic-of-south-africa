Parliament, Friday, 23 October 2020 – The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) today conducted an oversight visit to the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). The visit focused on the technical aspect of the entity, as the SABC’s audit outcome flagged the technical systems as irregular expenditure.
	
	Scopa appreciates the holistic view this oversight provided into the SABC’s compliance with the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA). Scopa was informed of the limitations the PFMA places on the SABC and other state-owned entities. As much as the SABC has a public mandate, it also has commercial ventures that pose a unique challenge to adherence to the law when it comes to some contracts.
	
	Scopa has been clear that deviations and expansions cannot be the norm. They should be used for exceptions only and that is why it is important for the SABC to test the market before resorting to deviations. The committee also appreciates the engagement with employees from the supply chain management department on the challenges they face in complying with the PFMA. Scopa noticed that there is generally a culture of disjointed communication about contract management between SABC departments and specifically in responding to requests from business units for deviations and expansions.
	
	There are challenges at the SABC, but Scopa appreciates the improvements that are taking place. Scopa has made a commitment to focus on the SABC until such time as it achieves a clean audit.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF SCOPA, MR MKHULEKO HLENGWA.
