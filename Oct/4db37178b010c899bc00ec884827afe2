Parliament, Wednesday, 21 October 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services started virtual public hearings on gender-based violence (GBV) Bills yesterday. The Bills are: Criminal Law (Sexual Offences), Domestic Violence Amendment, and Criminal and Related Matters Amendment Bill.
	
	The organisations that made presentations yesterday include the African National Congress Women’s League, Children’s Institute, Cosatu, the South African Police Service, and the Centre for Child Law. The committee engaged with each organisation after it has made its presentation.
	
	The committee expressed its unhappiness with the problems which the South African Police Service highlighted on the Bills in its presentation.
	
	The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Bulelani Magwanishe, said it was shocking to hear a government department expressing problems on the Bills that are produced by another government department during public hearings. “It is really shocking to say the least, to note that government departments don’t speak to each other. Don’t work in silos,” he added.
	
	The hearings continue today at 9 o’clock, and more organisations will make their presentations on the Bills.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON ON JUSTICE AND CORRECTIONAL SERVICES, MR BULELANI MAGWANISHE.
