Parliament, Wednesday, 7 October 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) will tomorrow, 8 October 2020, visit uMgungundlovu District Municipality as part of its four-day oversight visit to KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) to assess the state of service delivery.
	
	The aim of the oversight visit is to ensure that municipalities achieve their objectives as set out in Section 152 of the Constitution. “The perennial problem of negative audit outcomes by municipalities in the country is worrying and requires our collective resolve and focus if we are to change this worrying course. The committee in exercising its oversight role saw it prudent to visit KZN to assess implementation of audit improvement plans in the province,” said Ms Faith Muthambi, the Chairperson of the committee.
	
	The committee will also interact with stakeholders such as traditional leaders, ward councillors, rate payers’ associations, civic organisations, businesses and churches to find workable solutions to challenges facing municipalities. Following these interactions, the committee will visit various service delivery sites in the municipality.
