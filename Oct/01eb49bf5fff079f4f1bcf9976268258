Parliament, Tuesday, 20 October 2020 – The Ad Hoc Committee to Initiate and Introduce Legislation Amending Section 25 of the Constitution will on Thursday resume its public hearings, the first since the announcement of the national Covid-19 lockdown.
	
	The committee will travel in two groups. One group will visit Limpopo and another will travel to the Northern Cape in order to obtain public views on the matter. The following week the groups will visit the Western Cape, the only remaining province still to hold public hearings. The committee visited all the other provinces earlier in the year, prior to the outbreak of Covid-19, to obtain public input in how the Constitution should be amended.
