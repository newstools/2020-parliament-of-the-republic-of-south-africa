Parliament, Thursday, 8 October 2020 – The Portfolio Committee on Environment, Forestry and Fisheries has noted the precautionary suspension of eight officials from the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries following a forensic investigation into contracts alleged to have been irregularly awarded by the department’s Waste Management Bureau.
	
	The committee had recommended to the executive authority, the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, in last year’s Budgetary Review and Recommendation Report to pay due attention to the Auditor-General’s findings and take action for the dismal performance in the majority of the environmental portfolio. The committee specifically requested the Minister to authorise forensic audits into findings of irregular expenditure and fruitless and wasteful expenditure in the department to ensure that public funds are used optimally for the greatest public good. The committee considered this necessary in light of the Auditor-General’s determination that irregular expenditure could have been prevented had effective and appropriate steps been taken.
	
	The committee is therefore pleased with these suspensions and hopes that those found guilty are held to account and the public funds lost in these allegedly irregular processes are recovered expeditiously from the concerned parties. A strong message needs to be sent that the era of misappropriating public funds meant for the poor is over. Effective waste management plays an important role in enhancing the livelihoods of poor people.
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT, FORESTRY AND FISHERIES, MR FIKILE XASA.
