Parliament, Sunday, 25 October 2020 – Public hearings of the Ad Hoc Committee had to be delayed in Polokwane, Limpopo, today after the leader of the delegation had to have the hall evacuated after a group of people forced their way into an already full hall.
	
	The hall was initially full in compliance with Covid-19 level 1 regulations. However, a crowd forced its way past security and filled the hall to capacity.
	
	Adv Bongani Bongo refused to start the meeting as Parliament would be in contravention of the regulations. “Furthermore, it’s a safety and health risk. We cannot allow people to be exposed to this. I would rather start the hearings late until we have order, than put our people’s lives on the line. We have now agreed to rather start at 14:00 instead of 11:00.”
	
	ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMUNICATION SERVICES ON BEHALF OF THE LEADER OF THE LIMPOPO DELEGATION OF THE AD HOC COMMITTEE TO INITIATE AND INTRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDING SECTION 25 OF THE CONSTITUTION, ADV BONGANI BONGO.
