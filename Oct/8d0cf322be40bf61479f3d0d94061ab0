Parliament, Tuesday 13 October 2020 – The Presiding Officers, led by National Assembly Speaker Ms Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces Chairperson Mr Amos Masondo, are saddened to learn about the passing of struggle stalwart, veteran human rights lawyer and former Member of Parliament in the National Assembly, Devikarani Priscilla Sewpal Jana.
	
	A revered and courageous human rights lawyer who became Tata Madiba’s personal attorney while he was incarcerated on Robben Island, dedicated her entire adult life fighting for the dismantling of the apartheid system. With a sharp legal acumen and uncompromising pursuit for social justice and equality, Ms Jana was a thorn in the side of the oppressive regime which could not silence her despite its attempts.
	
	“We remember her for the love and dedication with which she served this country and its people till the end. She fought some of the most intense battles with security forces and stood up against the evil apartheid system to ensure that the dignity of all humans is respected. We salute this true hero of our people,” said the Presiding Officers.
	
	After the first democratic elections, Ms Jana became a Member of Parliament from 1994 to 1999 and later served as a South African ambassador to the Netherlands from 2001 to 2005 and ambassador to Ireland from 2006 to 2011.
	
	Following a rigorous Parliament selection process in 2016 Ms Jana was appointed as a Commissioner of the South African Human Rights Commission in January 2017 where she was installed as a Deputy Chairperson responsible for equality.
	
	Parliament sends its heartfelt condolences to her family and to many South Africans who were impacted by her extraordinary and inspiring life.
